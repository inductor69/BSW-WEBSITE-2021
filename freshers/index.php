# List of important documents to be brought by PG students <a href="pgforms.php" target = "_blank"><b style="color: rgb(8,29,60);">Click here.</b></a><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Clothing </b> - Here you are free to wear anything that you are comfortable in, be it jeans, t-shirt, trousers, shorts, skirt, salwar-kameez, kurti ,formals, etc - so bring whatever clothes you like! Also, you should bring an umbrella and/or raincoat to avoid getting drenched in the rainy season. You wouldn’t want to fall sick early in the semester right :P <br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Footwear </b> - Bring your footwear according to your convenience ( slippers/ sandals/ shoes, etc.). You would need shoes for the practical labs, so do bring a pair for yourself. <br><br>
 </li>
</ul>
<strong style="font-size: 22px;">Things you may bring </strong> <strong>( although you can always bring/buy them later if you think you don’t need them for the time being)</strong><br> 
<ul>
<li>
<b>Books</b> - The teachers usually suggest books related to their courses which are much more beneficial from the examination point of view so you need not bring your JEE books. But if you like you may, they might help you here or there. <br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Scientific Calculator </b> -  Scientific calculators are allowed in exams here. So if you already have bring it or you can purchase it here from SCOOPS. <br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Laptop </b> - You won't be needing laptops as such in your first year. We advise you not to bring or purchase a laptop in the first sem, but if you really need you can get it later into the semester. And you can always use the computers at CSC(Computer Services Center) anytime you want. <br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Equipment for Extracurricular Activities </b> - If you are interested in sports, music or any other activity and it requires equipment like racquet, bat, DSLR, flute, guitar, etc,  bring it along. You will surely get plenty of opportunities here to pursue your hobbies! <br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Table lamp/ Curtains </b> - It's totally up to you on how you want your room to be. So if you want you can bring such things along with you ( or purchase them here if it’s not possible for you to bring them here from your hometown) <br><br>
</li>
</ul> 
<strong style="font-size: 22px;">Things that we would advise you to buy here only </strong><strong>( as they are easily available and not worth the load on your luggage)</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Mattress, Pillows,etc </b> - During the orientation time, BSW would be organising camps from where you can buy mattresses, pillows, bed-sheets and pillow covers at reasonable prices. <br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Daily essentials </b> - Things like buckets, mugs, dustbin, locks, broom,  soap, shampoo, washing powder,etc can be purchased from either Gupta Provisional Store(opposite Nilgiri Hostel) or Neelkanth (a shopping complex near the Girls hostel gate). Also, every hostel has small provisional store from where the aforementioned items could be purchased.
