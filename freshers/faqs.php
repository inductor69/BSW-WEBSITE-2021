                            <p>In first year 900(approx.) students will be divided into two batches which will further
                                be divided into 20-20 groups. Each group contains 22-25 students. Strength of a single
                                class depends on the course which you would be studying. There might be 1, 2, 5, 10 or
                                20 groups present in a class. Now if you have doubts regarding how your classes are
                                going to take place then wait for it. You will get to know each and everything when you
                                will receive your class schedule.</p>

                            <p>The attendance policy is different for different courses depending on Professors. You
                                will be told about the attendance policy in the starting lecture itself. In general, the
                                students need to have a minimum attendance of 75%. If a student has an attendance of
                                less than 75%, then he/she may get a grade down in the course depending on the
                                Professor.</p>

                            <p>There is a book camp held at the beginning of every semester by BSW which provides books
                                at cheap prices. Apart from that notes and lab manuals which the professors suggest are
                                available at the Student Co-operative Society (SCOOPS) inside the campus itself. Also,
                                there is a place called Ber Sarai very close to the Hostel Gate of IIT, where you can
                                buy both new as well as second hand books on a returnable basis at a very low cost.
                                Otherwise, most of the suggested books are available as PDFs on the internet.</p>

                                While the rules are clear, we assure you it is going to be very tough for department
                                change, even tougher than getting CS at IIT Delhi. Do not come to IIT Delhi with the aim
                                of getting only depC, but with an aim to get highest CG and enjoy the courses, and you
                                would be a lot more happier.</p>

                            <p>To be honest, yes, they do to some extent. Almost every professor in all IIT teaches in
                                English, so you would face some troubles if you do not have a basic understanding of the
                                language.That said there are avenues for you to overcome this difficulty. There is a
                                language course too in the first year itself in IIT Delhi where the teachers help you in
                                speaking and understanding English, along with other help sessions. Also, there are
                                other measures being taken to help students but nothing works like helping yourself
                                out.</p>

                            bring any JEE books?</a>
                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>We have nptel.ac.in and ETSC in IIT Delhi where you can find some of the videos, although
                                not all. But that doesn't mean that you stop listening in their class because sometimes
                                they upload only the summary of what they actually teach. So many students who do not
                                listen in the lecture face problems later. Also, you don't essentially need to bring any
                                of your JEE coaching books here, because the teachers suggest their own books which
                                actually are much more beneficial from the exams point of view, as compared to your JEE
                                books.</p>

                            <p>In the first year Lectures generally take place in large lecture rooms with almost 200
                                students. So it is difficult for the professors to take time to talk to students
                                one-on-one. Moreover duration of any lecture is generally 1-2 hours so it is quite
                                difficult to clear everyone’s doubt but you can clear it afterwards by taking
                                appointment with the professors. Moreover we have tutorial classes with the Teaching
                                Assistants where you can clear any doubts of yours any time. So to sum up, we have
                                lectures+tutorial classes of any course. And that allows students to clear their
                                concepts and doubts easily during lectures and tutorial classes</p>

                                regarding the course. You may contact the professor after the class and ask when he is
                                free and then go and meet him in his office. You may meet a TA after your tutorial and
                                clear all your doubts.In fact we encourage you to meet your TAs and professors as

                                Lectures and Tutorials : One lecture or tutorial hour per week over the period of one 14

                                On obtaining a pass grade, the student accumulates the course credits as earned credits.

                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>Grading basically depends on the course coordinator. In most of the cases relative
                                grading is done, i.e. depending on the score of whole class, Professor decides what
                                grade is to be given for what total. Usually a grade point of 7 is given if a student
                                obtains average (mean marks of the whole class) marks.
                                The minimum marks for award of an ‘A’ grade or 10 grade point is 80 % and the minimum
                                marks for award of ‘D’ grade or minimum passing grade is 30 %. However, it may vary
                                according to the Professor.<br>
                                Consider an example, In a particular course if professor sets 9 grade point at a score
                                of 65 and 10 at a score of 75 then students who have scored between 65 and 75 get 9 and
                                above 75 get 10.</p>

                            <p>Generally, there 2 minors and a major. In the first class, your professor would tell you
                                the weightage of each one and also if he/she would be taking any class quizzes or
                                surprise quizzes or even if there are marks for attendance. If there are no quizzes or
                                additional marks, weightage is 25% for each minor and 50% for major, but then, lot of it
                                depends on how course coordinator plans the course. Worry not, everything would be made
                                clear in the first class.</p>

                            <p>If you are unable to pass the course in one go, then a re-major exam is conducted at the
                                end of the semester, if you are close to total passing marks. If you fail in that exam
                                too, then you have to repeat the entire course. Also, you may get a semester back or a
                                year back if you fail in all many courses. So don't believe your JEE coaching teachers
                                who say that you have to study only for those 2 crucial years and not, once you get into

                            <p>Generally any course in IIT Delhi has a single course co-ordinator who is responsible for all things related to course like syllabus,attendance policy,minors and majors etc.If their are large number of students taking the course the class is divided into sub batches which are taught by different pr    ofessors.Also if the course covers different sections they can be covered by different professors.Since there are large number of students several TA’s  are also there for a course who are generally post-grad students.They take up tutorial classes and check your exam papers.</p>

                            <p>Plagiarism is considered as a big  issue in IIT Delhi. You are not expected to copy anyone’s assignment or take help from someone in your projects. You are also expected to mention the source of data if you have taken it from somewhere and used it in any of your assignment.If the concerned professor finds out any of such act on your part you can land in huge trouble. You may have to face Disciplinary Committee and any disciplinary action can be taken against you.</p>

                            <p>No. IIT Delhi is one of the strictest institutes in India when it comes to this. No girl
                                can enter beyond the visitor's room in a boy's hostel and vice-versa.<br>
                                Only on one day(the house day) can a girl have complete access in some boys hostel. For
                                entering the girls' hostels, it’s either the house day(Complete access) or the
                                informals(limited access) held annually.</p>

                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>From childhood to adulthood, high school allows you to gain a sense of what it will be
                                like to be an adult.<br>
                                On the other hand, IIT Delhi allows you to fully take ownership of your time,
                                responsibilities and who you want to become.<br>
                                As long as you’re able to stay on track of the goal at hand, i.e. getting marvelous
                                grades, being involved in some extra curriculars, keeping a smart schedule and studying
                                like crazy, you’ll be just fine. In college, balance is the key. Work a lot, have more
                                fun.Enjoy with your friends. Be in touch with your mentor. Outings,Night outs and what
                                not you will experience in your coming days. <br>
                                If it sounds pretty great, that’s because it absolutely is. But the ultimate truth is,
                                you have to be focused on why you came here. Just wasting time on parties and hanging
                                out is not worth it. Its fun only if you balance it.</p>

                            <p>Well 1 Km won’t be big deal because you will become habitual of walking 4-5 Kms daily.
                                Moreover Auto rickshaw and normal rikshaw are continuously operated in the campus but
                                their frequency is more during the daytime than the nighttime.Institute buses also move
                                during day hours. <br>
                                Also many students use personal cycles for transportation which they park in the hostel
                                and cycle stands in institute area.
                                But regarding the purchase of cycles, cycle purchase camps are organised by BSW in the
                                campus only so no need to worry. </p>

                                weekends, only 20-25 percent. But after second semester students prefer spending time in
                                hostels during weekends with their friends.Moreover you all will get engaged in
                                different stuff that you won’t get any free time to go home during weekends.</p>

                            <p>Every college has student groups and clubs. In the beginning of the semester, everyone is
                                new and looking to make friends, so it isn't awkward to walk in alone. It is easier to
                                make friends when you have a common interest and are doing something together instead of
                                being at a party, or trying to talk to a stranger.
                                Look at the list of clubs on the BSW website and also most clubs have some sort of
                                welcome event. Pick some you might be interested in and go to them. Then you will settle
                                into the ones that fit you and go to their weekend activities. As you make friends there
                                will be more opportunities to hang out, go to movies and so on.
                                Don’t hesitate to pick up a DSLR or a keyboard, there would be lots of people to help
                                you learn it.</p>
